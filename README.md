# NOMAD

![nomad-banner](Cover/nomad-banner.webp)

This is a wabbajack list for Fallout 4 that aims to shape the gameplay into a unique direction, one of solitude and atmosphere, and gritty immersion.

Id say I was inspired by the S.T.A.L.K.E.R games and their associated overhaul mods, also Ultimate Skyrim for Skyrim LE and Serenity for Skyrim SE.
Immersion and realism, are kinda dirty words in modding these days, but I still like them.

It builds upon the excellent Welcome to Paradise Fallout 4 list by Phoenix, but uses only the graphics and bugfixes sections of that list, the rest is custom.

## READ THIS BIT FIRST

First and foremost - PLEASE READ THIS IF NOTHING ELSE: I have HEAVILY modified many many mods in this list, so they often look nothing like what they started out as.
For this reason please do NOT go to the original authors on Nexusmods for support if something seems wrong, come to me on the wabbajack Discord, or log an issue on this github.

For example - for many of the weapon mods I have removed the scripted leveled list injections and remade leveled lists by hand, and stopped them from being hand-placed in the world. If you read the original mods description you may be expecting something to appear ingame, that would not in this list.  If you go to the original mod author saying something is wrong you will either make them angry or be laughed at.

## PERFORMANCE:


I have an i5-9400f and a 1070ti , and 16GB of RAM.
I run the game at 1440p resolution, and get 50-70 fps in outside areas dropping to 40 or so in built-up areas of inner Boston etc, and 80-100 fps in interiors
I would suggest that a 1060 and probably even far below that, would be fine at 1080p.
I dont know about 4k, or ultrawide, but please let me know how that works out if you do have it.


## GRAPHICS:


All carried over from Welcome to Paradise list by Phoenix, although I have added a reshade filter, to add a gloomier atmosphere and darker nights, and a sharpening filter to get rid of the TAA blurry smear.
If you arent a fan of this , you can press the HOME button on your keyboard to bring up the reshade menu and disable the filters.


## QUICKSTART:


If you dont want to read all this crap, just do this bit to install the list.

After wabbajack has finished, copy the CONTENTS of the "Game Folder Files" folder in the list install directory, into your Fallout 4 steam directory.

After starting the game, you will go straight from the Bathroom scene where you create your character , and then pick your stats, then teleport to the vault exit sequence.

**After this, open the mod config menu, select the very first entry there on the top which is "MCM settings manager" and then click apply on the preset that is displayed there.**

Thats it, your done.

## GAMEPLAY TIPS

ENSURE YOU DID THE ABOVE - SELECT MCM SETTINGS MANAGER AND APPLY THE PRESET.

You will die easily. Saving happens at campfires, sleeping in beds, and smoking cigars or ciggarettes - Make use of these before battles. 

Return to camp often to save and heal and rest.
You will not heal from food and water at all, you will heal a bit from sleeping.
You will not heal much from stimpaks, bandages and rest are what you need.

After you die you will respawn at last bed you slept in, with 80% cap on your health, and famished and dehydrated, with stat penalties, Kill some enemies to recover from these penalties, this simualtes you crawling back to base and recovering over time.

Armor pieces can protect somewhat against bleeding to various locations, the more coverage, the better.

Crippled limbs can be healed with splints or (better) First aid kit or (even better ) first aid kit with surgical supplies/doctors kit

There is no settlement building at all, except for at Vault 88 or Mechanists Lair. Player housing is currently a work in progress ( I need to find a good replacement for settlement building in home plate for example )

You will not get the good pistols appearing in loot until level 10+, and rifles level 20+

good pre-war guns sell for a lot and cost a lot, but are rarer to drop.

You start the game with a mobile workbench, this simulates all of the vanilla workbenches plus some more in a menu, drop the ECO workbench or hotkey its related tool to access it, use this to craft anything.

Craft camping gear early on, craft bedroll so you can rest in safe locations ( not all locations are completely safe to rest in, be warned! - interiors are slightly safer than exteriors, and NPC owned settlements are even safer. And your luck attribute contributes to this safety calculation )

You cannot camp in the grounds of a faction/NPC settlement, until you are allied to them.

Craft bandages, youll need them, craft splints, have stashes of food and water and medicaal supplies at your most recent basecamp, if you respawn there.

Craft custom fast travel beacons from the Utility section of the ECO bench, you can place up to 5 of these at a time, and travel between them for a cost.

Radiation is now far more prevalent in hot pockets dotted around the landscape, and is far more damaging, and amplified in food and water.
Choosing equipment with radiation protection over physical protection is now a very real choice.
In vanilla F4 radiation was hardly ever a concern, now it is.

Craft a placeable storage bag from the Utility section of the ECO bench so you can stash your loot at your basecamps.

Hunt animals to get their meat and skin. - Ensure you have a knife or other sharp melee weapon to butcher them.

When you are in pain, use painkillers or strong booze to reduce it.

You can also use a fishing rod to fish in rivers.

Dogmeat can be equipped with backpacks to increase his carrying capacity, so can you.

Crossbows and Bows are a good fallback option to craft as their ammo wont be as scarce as others - use with stealth for maximum effect.

Crafting objects will now take time, based on the number of their components. 

Crafting does not give any XP

Bandages can be dirty (infection risk) , boiled(will add rads), or sterile (best)

Armor now has encumbrance values based on its weight, which slows down the player speed and reduces action points, making lighter armor a more viable option later into the game.

There is a Simplistic mental health/PTSD system in place, where the more humans you kill, the more your already stressed mind suffers ( hey you lost your partner and kid and the world has ended, and you are already a veteran ( well the male player is ), so some artistic license to suggest the player is already susceptible to this ).
The effects of this system can be alleviated by petting dogmeat, taking chems, and smoking.

More purified water recipes, craft empty bottles, get bottles back from drinking. More adhesive recipes.

## CHANGES AND NOTABLE MODS

Agony

Better Locational Damage

Damn Apocalypse

Minutemans Last Stand

Last Man Standing (modified)

Crafting Takes Time

Campsite

Hunter of the Commonwealth

Equipment and Crafting Overhaul (modified)

Caliber Complex

PTSD Mental Health Management

Armor Encumbrance

Around 180 added guns of various types, some of which are craftable.

Around 600 new armor and clothing pieces, many of which are craftable.

Many new ammo calibers that are also craftable, with the features from Weapons of Fate integrated

All of which hand placed into custom leveled lists that distribute them into the world appropiately.

You will not see the valuable pre-war guns before level 10 or so, and only the post-war scrap ones are craftable.

Most of the armor is craftable however, but gated behind later perks.

Power Armor mods are the same as from Welcome to Paradise, with Consistent Power Armor Overhaul, Take your cores, restore power armor frames, and some assembly required. ( fusion core drain rebalanced due to no fast travel - drains less )

West-tek tactical optics

No Power armor or minigun in Concord, because fuck you thats why.

No already-built crafting benches or power armor crafting bench in Sanctuary or Red Rocket, because fuck you thats why

Weapons are uniformly more expensive to purchase, especially prewar ones!
