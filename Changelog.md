## **v0.972**

lowered RPG launcher cost

moved RPG ammo switch consumable to ammo bench ( even though eco quick menu can do it anyway)

tweaked reshade to have less blown out blacks and less red tint

moved CK scripts/sources to a mod in MO2 and cleaned up compile inlines/excludes etc

fixed Nuka World no bad choice so it dosnt automatically move on to the comnmonwealth expansion

## **v0.971**

Added Machineurl to compilation

removed some extra included files from compilatioon

## **v0.97**

fixed myrna glittering hair - and anyone that uses that hair ( this one might pop up again - problem with automation patchers :( )

buffed all power armor armor values

reduced rad resist of gunner spec ops agent armor

some crafting benches placed in homeplate settlement are in spanish idk why lol - fixed that

increased 50 cal ammo damage

added better power armor - redux

added advanced flashbang

added heavy impact power armor sounds

added armor penetration bug fix

added enjoy the darkness stealth change

multipled all armor values across the board to the power of 1.2 then x3, this is necessary to balance for true damage and intended scale of calibers to armor penetration
Now a 9mm pistol will kill a lightly armored person in a few hits, but ping mostly off heavy armor leaving them unharmed.

Now with the better power armor redux and these armor/true damage changes, power armor enemies are absolute tanks, use anti-material calibers or explosions on them.

Increased the rad resist of already rad resisting armor values disproportionately on the higher end
( radiation is increased across the world hugely in this list, but the higher end radresist armor didnt protect fully against it - now it does - the lower end rad resist armor still wont be enough, though mitigated somewhat )

reduced melee sound volume a bit

reduced worldspace radio volume a bit

fixed Mk23 soccom innr naming


## **v0.96**

reduced mutant menagerie damage resistances significantly, through Scourge MCM preset

Added legendary effect overhaul

Enabled ECO Armor recipes ( with relevant gates ) , this may make the crafting menus more crowded but its a hell of a lot of additional stuff for very little work on my part :)

Patched Automatically lowered weapons to only lower when flashlight is off

## **v0.95**

uncapped fps in loading screens

increased fat man value

fixed military ghoul fatigues making disappearing ankles with more feral ghouls mod

## **v0.93**

redid face and body textures to avoid some brownface, I dont really know this stuff, so ended up with a nifty synthesis patcher to distribute morphed presets to avoid all that kerfuffle of which NPC replacer wants which texture etc
This ends up with some hat clipping but whatevs

fixed pipboy flashlight weird shadows ( the dynamic shadow options dont work on that mod!)

removed Vault jumpsuits from civilian leveled lists

reduced frequency of hats in civilian leveled lists

## **v0.92**

reduced healing values and added radiation to mutant menagerie foods

removed level-based damage scaling, we need to feel badass when we get to higher levels!

fixed UMP omod caliber swaps referring to pre-caliber complex calibers

reduced armor values of some gunner armor

reduced rad resist of gunner gas masks

increased armor value of b90

decreased armor value of PMC operator

reduced value of some junkier junk parts

disabled Hunter of the commonwealth dismember on butcher because I learned the hard way that boombugs explode on dismember

increased vendor cap amounts, (ive made trading unfair enough as it is to get the really good guns, its just painful to go from vendor to vendor to sell all your stuff or wait until their cap inventory respawns.)


## **v0.91**

rebalanced some pistol calibers to be weaker

rebalanced raider armor to be weaker

removed some leftover crafting filter keywords

removed useful crank for laser musket as it ruined the reason for crossbow/bow to exist.

Fixed duplicate uility filter keyword categories for fishing rod

fixed broken previs i usaf sattelite staiton olivia

Fixed bullet sounds when throwing grenades

Fixed bleeding still applying after death respawn


## **v0.90**
Near total rebuild.

Gone are many many awkward and problem prone mods, simplified and streamlined.

Removed BLD and Agony and Survival First Aid etc

Replaced with a complementary set of mods that are designed for each other - Maim, Scourge, True Damage.

Added bullet penetration framework, and weapon jam framework, patched for all gun mods with synthesis automation.

Added a few quest mods for a testing phase

Added a bunch of weapon casing/sound/impact mods for more dynamic gunplay.

Added performout fancy textures as a base replacer for all Betheseda textures, before more specific texture mods overwrite certain ones.

Added A Forest and grass mods for a more realistic overgrown post-apocalyptic world.

Changed pipe weapon retexture mod to one thats less rusty

Added True Grass

Fixed Blood Textures on corpses

Removed VATS

Added Scaling weapon damage based on perception - now that VATS is gone, perception needs more of a use.

Added ammo switching with ECO quick menu to Crossbow, LString bow, and RPG.

Added critical hits outside of vats but reduced their frequency.

Added locky bastard mod for more lockpicking options

Added more carry weight bonuses in power armor

But no sneaking in power armor

HEavy weapons require strength to use effectively

Remove combat boundaries so enemies can follow more often through loading doors

Added better strenght bonuses to bashing with guns

Added more feral ghouls and feral ghouls expansion pack

Added a bunch of base object swapper mods for more variety in the world

Added playable guitars

Fixed more handless and naked gunner armor spawns, there will probably be more though, that mod is a pain in my ass

Added flashbang mod

Speeded up character creation by removing initial voice-over

Added mutant menagerie


## **v0.71**

Added wheelmenu

Fixed version number in Mo2

## **v0.70**

Added Boat to Spectacle Island mod
Added Junkier Junk mod - so misc static junk can be picked up and scrapped

Fixed ECO workbench AGAIN as my previous fix unfixed it.

## **v0.60**

Fixed Gunner Combat Outfit(Grunt) had no hands

Fixed Makeshift SMG OMOD description referring to old calibers

Reduced stats slightly on Makeshift SMG as it was too good ( its meant to be makeshift! )

Increased stats on XM2076 sniper slightly to match its rarity and cost

Increased stats on DKS-501 sniper slightly ( as above )

Reduced protection and raised weight of Scavenged NCR Armor as it was pretty much better than anything else

FIxed Stetchkin APS going to a fire rate of 0 when converted back to semi-auto

Increased ammo availability from Vendors at mid-range levels and higher

Increased damage of FN FAL slightly as it was weaker than comparable combat rifles

Reduced Stetchkin APS damage when converted to 10mm, as it was much higher than comparable pistols

Added Binoculars and Tactical optics to levelled lists as they were pretty much impossible to find

Removed Preston as script properties in quests trying to reference him

Removed most of the "Last man standing" mod; the only thing really left of it is the name and a few edits - as the only feature I used from it was the quest changes to remove the minutemen, and I reimplemented that in a better way ( see below )

Previously quests like Mionrecruit02 ( Abernathy farm ) werent able to start, even by talking directly to Blake, because of the way I removed Workshops, a few quests actually required the workshops to be present.
So what I did was enable the workbenches, but move them far underground so player cant use them, but quests can.

Id rather not fix it this way as it seems that some more bugs could creep through, but the only other alternative was to just not have these quests available at all, which wasnt acceptable for me.

Fixed a lot of dangling properties and such causing mostly harmless spam in papyrus log

Removed Nicotine addiction from cigs, its just annoying when smoking cigs is the primary saving method now

Disabled papyrus logging in release build

Disabled BLD popping up its messages on every game load

ACtually for real removed Junk Category from ECO workbench

Made SLeepness nights too safe a few patches ago, bumped up its chances a bit now. Might tweak to find the middle ground later

Goodneighbor neighborhood watch outfits , clipped more than usual with the torso armor part of their leveled lists, so removed that part.

Fixed M1 Carbine automatic conversion actually reducing rate of fire

Reduced price of antibiotics slightly

## **v0.52**

Changed all projectile gravity settings as they were dropping hugely, the author of caliber complex I think associated gravity with projectile weight, with values as high as 6.0 for 50 bmg but 1.0 for .22 LR , which didnt always give correct drop off behavior considering projectile velocity.

10mm at average engagement range of approx 20m needed to aim 2 inches (screenspace measurements) above targets head - obviously too much

Have edited all of the gravity values individually on a caliber by caliber basis, and tested the results ingame. 308 is relatively flat for example, and handgun calibers drop off more, but less than they did.

Fixed projectiles from suppressed guns always pointing their flash graphic North

Reduced length of new game start popup message to make text not so small

updated and expanded Readme

## **v0.51**

Removed ECO Junk crafting option as it was empty anyway
Fixed Lstring bow MCM hotkey for arrow switching

## **v0.50**

Removed ECO options for directly modifying legendary slots and damage/zoom levels of every weapon

Added compass back to HUD but without enemy markers etc

removed ihud compass/toggle aid items

Removed mental health mod, it was simplistic and ended up having zero gameplay interactions in every playthrough I did, I want to bring it back at some point but only when its a full concept that really impacts gameplay

Fixed a couple of OMOD naming issues

## **v0.40**

Removed ECO OMOD stripper mod as it was un-needed and had problems in this setup

removed redundant SKK OMOD stripper as it was workshop only

Removed other workshop/settlement mods as they were redundant

Some consistency patching for various armor pieces

Slightly reduced armor encumbrance penalty

Amended stash bag script to not stash caps and lockpicks by default

Added Journal of the sole survivor mod, and edited it to be added to inventory on game start

Replaced useless Local Leader perk with one that improves charisma while only wearing non-combat, non-armor clothing

Made vanilla projectiles more inline with WOF-style BLD-style Caliber-complex projectiles, even when most vanilla stuff is converted to calcomplex, certain OMODs will revert to vanilla projectiles.

Edited startup text to be non gender-specific with the mention of killed "wife"

Edited consitency and naming with various guns

Removed HK GSG3 as it had unexplainable range issues I couldnt fix.

Fixed HK23 INNR naming conventions

## **v0.30**

Removed G43 rifle damage mods

Removed Makarov Pistol, it had issues

Updated ENB binaries

Removed most of survivalist first aid except for Splints

Added Sleep on Couches

Added ECO crafting bench to start game items

Custom Fast Travel Beacons

Removed Journey mod

Removed all misc junk and unbalanced vanilla armor recipes from ECO COBJ lists

Use BLD Bleeding mechanics instead

Use DamnApo/BLD/Agony multi-patch to integrate

Removed all workshops, and all workbenches, and all settlement building (except for vault 88, mechanists lair , boston airport )

Pulowski Bomb shelters protect from rad storms

Rebalance VATS slowdown to be a bit easier

Alcohol reduces pain

Added ECO OMOD stripper

Buff Crossbow slightly

Removed Hunting Kit COBJ ( as using Hunter of the commonwealth instead )

Removed Weapons of Fate as Caliber COmplex had same features anyway

Added BLD bleeding notification script

Custom placeable storage duffel bag

Reduced chances of sleepness nights encounters

various other consistency and bug patches


## **v0.21**

Added Quicktrade

Fixed up some weirdness in the purified water recipes ( now water purifier outputs 3 at once, and recipes arent duplicated )

Blocked Covenant workshop from becoming under player control after its quest

Fixed crosshairs in immersive hud

Fixed weirdness with bandages and their recipes.

Fixed radio stations not becoming available on new game with SKK Fast start

Fixed some more nude NPCs by removing hooded rags from body leveled lists

Fixed ENB stealth update


## **v0.2**

Fall UI minimal HUD preset added

Immersive HUD now correctly hides all HUD elements when pressing X key

Remove hooded rags from leveled lists that were supposed to be head-free, causing clothes-less NPCs

Removed NEST Bunkers mod - neat idea, too much free stuff.

Exclude companions ( dogmeat etc ) from the bleeding mechanics, which caused them to constantly re-die.

Remove Quaz vehicle overhaul, some missing textures and vehicles in the path of NPCs and dogmeats sniffing quest.

Block activation of the "smoke to save" animation of cigars and cigarettes, whilst in combat.

Fix Sanctuary Bridge doubling

Covert Pistol was showing as unique - fixed.

Even less food now placed in the world

Bandage recipes were duplicated, one with a bobby pin - removed duplicates

Changed bandage recipes to be slightly more expensive in components when crafted at a campfire, compared to chem bench

Reduced gun prices by around 25% across the board

But added a silent perk to player that reduces sell prices by 15% and raises buy prices by 15%

Removed Youre SPECIAL perk overhaul and tag skills mod - I didnt like the level up menu, and it had problems with lockpicking/hacking/pacify while aiming

Removed P90 SMG gun, as it had its animation subgraphdata overwritten anyway, and a patch would be very messy

Workshop scrap time wasnt working correctly, no time was passing when object scrapped, fixed this.

Doctors now remove the Death Penalty mod debuffs as part of their usual health restore services

Changed threshold for low health Monochrome screen space effect, reduced it so it dosnt happen as much

Removed PJAR Pistol mod, it had some weird spawn settings with its legendary variants, and it didnt add much that I didnt already have anyway.

Removed everyones best friend mod, as it was being overwritten anyway from survival mods, and I want Dogmeat to be a choice rather than a default companion + dogmeat.

Fixed Notifications popping up with black bars from overlapping elements.


## **v0.12**

Road Goggles were causing crashes in workbenches - dont know why. Just removed them

Fixed Makeshift Shotgun model

Reduced protection values for PMC operator outfits, they were very high.

Increased Health and Damage Resist and speed of supermutants and deathclaws, they were far too easy in my playthrough

fixed script for pet dogmeat so it forces third person when you activate dogmeat, so the animation can actually start

Ensured that PTSD is not alleviated for every "chem" as it previously was set to, so that bandages etc dont reduce PTSD.

Added Binoculars to levelled lists

Added Coffee to Levelled lists

I had intended to cap health at 80% after dying, but had set 20% in the Death Penalty MCM instead, this was very harsh and could cause death spirals, fixed to 80% now

Not quite happy with survival first aid mod, but will save that for a future version to overhaul it.

Added messagebox after character creation to explain that some things will be very different, so that hopefully players read the readme.
