v0.12

Road Goggles were causing crashes in workbenches - dont know why. Just removed them
Fixed Makeshift Shotgun model
Reduced protection values for PMC operator outfits, they were very high.
Increased Health and Damage Resist and speed of supermutants and deathclaws, they were far too easy in my playthrough
fixed script for pet dogmeat so it forces third person when you activate dogmeat, so the animation can actually start
Ensured that PTSD is not alleviated for every "chem" as it previously was set to, so that bandages etc dont reduce PTSD.
Added Binoculars to levelled lists
Added Coffee to Levelled lists
I had intended to cap health at 80% after dying, but had set 20% in the Death Penalty MCM instead, this was very harsh and could cause death spirals, fixed to 80% now
Not quite happy with survival first aid mod, but will save that for a future version to overhaul it.
Added messagebox after character creation to explain that some things will be very different, so that hopefully players read the readme.
