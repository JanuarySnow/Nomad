## **v0.21**

Added Quicktrade

Fixed up some weirdness in the purified water recipes ( now water purifier outputs 3 at once, and recipes arent duplicated )

Blocked Covenant workshop from becoming under player control after its quest

Fixed crosshairs in immersive hud

Fixed weirdness with bandages and their recipes.

Fixed radio stations not becoming available on new game with SKK Fast start

Fixed some more nude NPCs by removing hooded rags from body leveled lists

Fixed ENB stealth update


## **v0.2**

Fall UI minimal HUD preset added

Immersive HUD now correctly hides all HUD elements when pressing X key

Remove hooded rags from leveled lists that were supposed to be head-free, causing clothes-less NPCs

Removed NEST Bunkers mod - neat idea, too much free stuff.

Exclude companions ( dogmeat etc ) from the bleeding mechanics, which caused them to constantly re-die.

Remove Quaz vehicle overhaul, some missing textures and vehicles in the path of NPCs and dogmeats sniffing quest.

Block activation of the "smoke to save" animation of cigars and cigarettes, whilst in combat.

Fix Sanctuary Bridge doubling

Covert Pistol was showing as unique - fixed.

Even less food now placed in the world

Bandage recipes were duplicated, one with a bobby pin - removed duplicates

Changed bandage recipes to be slightly more expensive in components when crafted at a campfire, compared to chem bench

Reduced gun prices by around 25% across the board

But added a silent perk to player that reduces sell prices by 15% and raises buy prices by 15%

Removed Youre SPECIAL perk overhaul and tag skills mod - I didnt like the level up menu, and it had problems with lockpicking/hacking/pacify while aiming

Removed P90 SMG gun, as it had its animation subgraphdata overwritten anyway, and a patch would be very messy

Workshop scrap time wasnt working correctly, no time was passing when object scrapped, fixed this.

Doctors now remove the Death Penalty mod debuffs as part of their usual health restore services

Changed threshold for low health Monochrome screen space effect, reduced it so it dosnt happen as much

Removed PJAR Pistol mod, it had some weird spawn settings with its legendary variants, and it didnt add much that I didnt already have anyway.

Removed everyones best friend mod, as it was being overwritten anyway from survival mods, and I want Dogmeat to be a choice rather than a default companion + dogmeat.

Fixed Notifications popping up with black bars from overlapping elements.


## **v0.12**

Road Goggles were causing crashes in workbenches - dont know why. Just removed them

Fixed Makeshift Shotgun model

Reduced protection values for PMC operator outfits, they were very high.

Increased Health and Damage Resist and speed of supermutants and deathclaws, they were far too easy in my playthrough

fixed script for pet dogmeat so it forces third person when you activate dogmeat, so the animation can actually start

Ensured that PTSD is not alleviated for every "chem" as it previously was set to, so that bandages etc dont reduce PTSD.

Added Binoculars to levelled lists

Added Coffee to Levelled lists

I had intended to cap health at 80% after dying, but had set 20% in the Death Penalty MCM instead, this was very harsh and could cause death spirals, fixed to 80% now

Not quite happy with survival first aid mod, but will save that for a future version to overhaul it.

Added messagebox after character creation to explain that some things will be very different, so that hopefully players read the readme.
